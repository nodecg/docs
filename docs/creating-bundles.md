## Examples {#examples}

Before continuing, you may find it helpful to look over our [collection of simple example bundles](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg-simple-examples).

## Using Yeoman {#yeoman}

1. Use Yeoman and [generator-nodecg](https://github.com/nodecg/generator-nodecg) to generate the beginnings of your new bundle:

   ```bash
   npm install --global yo generator-nodecg
   cd bundles
   mkdir my-first-bundle
   cd my-first-bundle
   yo nodecg
   ```

   Answer the prompts one-by-one as they come up.  
   - If you wish to access the TypeScript boilerplate, just answer yes to the TypeScript prompt.  
   - If you wish to access the React boilerplate, first answer yes to the TypeScript prompt and then also answer yes to the React prompt (we currently have a TypeScript+React template but not a plain JavaScript+React template).

   :::note
   If you created the bundle with typescript (plain typescript or react) you have to compile the bundle using `npm run build` inside the `my-first-bundle` directory.  
   (This is likely your issue if you see something like: `Error: my-first-bundle has a "nodecg.dashboardPanels" property in its package.json, but no "dashboard" folder` when trying to start nodecg)
   :::

2. If you generated your bundle with TypeScript, you can use the "dev" script to start NodeCG, automatically re-compile your code when it changes, and also automatically restart NodeCG when specifically server-side code changes (such as your extension):

   ```bash
   # From the root of your new bundle's folder
   npm run dev
   ```

   Else, you can start NodeCG the old-fashioned way with the CLI:

   ```bash
   cd ../..
   nodecg start
   ```

   :::note
   When running NodeCG in production, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) are recommended.
   :::

3. Open the NodeCG Dashboard, which will be located at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) by default. You should see a page like this:

4. That's it! You can click the "Graphics" button in the top right to see a list of graphics in your installed bundles.
