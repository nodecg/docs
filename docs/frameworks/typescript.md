NodeCG is natively written in TypeScript and has type definitions for all APIs.

## Setup

Install TypeScript as your bundle's dev dependency.

```bash
npm install -D typescript
# or
yarn add -D typescript
```

## Typing Replicants

Optionally, you can define types of replicants using replicants' JSON schema.

1. Define schema for replicants
1. Use [`nodecg-cli`](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg-cli)'s `nodecg schema-types` command to convert JSON schema to TypeScript type definitions
1. Import the type and pass it to type parameter like this:

```ts
import { ExampleReplicant } from '../types/schemas/example_replicant';
const rep = nodecg.Replicant<ExampleReplicant>('example_replicant')
```

## Using Type Definitions

To use NodeCG's type definitions, you'll need to first install them, as they are distributed as a separate package to keep things light and portable:

```bash
npm install -D @nodecg/types
# or
yarn add -D @nodecg/types
```

The majority of the types are used by importing the types package and referencing the types that way, but to access the browser globals (`window.nodecg` and `window.NodeCG`), an extra step is required. You'll need to modify your bundle's `tsconfig.json` files(s) in one of two ways achieve this:

The first approach is to use [`include`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include) to reference the file that augments the window object:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", "node_modules/@nodecg/types/augment-window.d.ts"]
}
```

If you use Vue, be sure to include your `*.vue` files as well:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "**/*.vue", "node_modules/@nodecg/types/augment-window.d.ts"]
}
```

The second approach is to use [`types`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#types):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["node", "jest", "express", "@nodecg/types/augment-window"]
  }
}
```

Both of these approaches have pros and cons, so be sure to read their corresponding [TypeScript tsconfig.json docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) thoroughly.

### extension

```ts
import NodeCG from '@nodecg/types'

export = (nodecg: NodeCG.ServerAPI) => {
  nodecg.sendMessage('message')
}
```

### dashboard/graphics

```ts
// Some types get automatically injected into the global scope by our tsconfig.json.
// For everything else, you can `import NodeCG from '@nodecg/types'` just as in our extension example.
nodecg.listenFor('message', () => {
  // ...
})
```
