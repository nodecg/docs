This has been in the making for a while now but the final checks have been completed and NodeCG v2 is released!

## What's changed?

For bundle developers? Nothing really... but in a good way. This means that bundles can be migrated over to v2 with little to no changes required. This update is more about making it easier for NodeCG core developers to develop new features that you can use in the future.

Please refer to the [migration docs](/docs/migrating/migrating-1.x-to-2.x) for more information and if you need any help please don't hesitate to reach out to the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GJ4r8a8)!

## Typescript rewrite

The biggest and most important change for NodeCG is that it is now written in TypeScript. This will greatly benefit developers of NodeCG and also allow bundle developers to more easily use types through the @nodecg/types package.

## NodeCG repository now contains only source code

NodeCG used to contain the built code along in the repository. This was helpful since all that was needed was to install the dependencies and you were off to the races. However in v2 this has changed. If you use `nodecg-cli` then make sure to download the latest version (`npm i -g nodecg-cli@latest`). Developers who would clone manually must now install all dependencies and run `npm run build` themselves.

## Running into issues?

If you are having any issues at all with version 2 please post an [issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg/issues) or reach out to our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GJ4r8a8).

## Future

NodeCG waiting to be rewritten in TypeScript was a major blocker for new developments to the project. It was also such a massive undertaking which is why it took so long to develop.

Now that it's written in TypeScript we can start developing new features that have been long requested such as:

- Levelled permissions
- Reworked project structure
- Better bundle management
- Internationalization
- Updating the dashboard UI to React
- and more!
