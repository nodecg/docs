NodeCG will try and require your bundle's extensions folder, so if used an index.js file is needed. Each extension must export a function that accepts a NodeCG API instance as its first and only argument. Not all bundles might require an extension to back them up, but you should consider one if your bundle might be handling any API work. Example: // nodecg/bundles/your-bundle/extension.js module.exports = nodecg =&gt; { nodecg.listenFor('foo', () =&gt; { console.log('bar'); }); };  NodeCG automatically attempts to load the following files as extensions: nodecg/bundles/your-bundle/extension.jsnodecg/bundles/your-bundle/extension/index.js Your bundle may have one of, but not both of the above files. If your extension is simple enough to fit in one file, use the former approach. If your extension is broken up into multiple files, you may want to use the latter structure and keep all those files in a single extension folder. If using an extension folder, NodeCG will only load your-bundle/extension/index.js. It is up to you to load any other files that your extension needs via require.

"},{"title":"Advanced Deployment​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Docker","url":"/docs/docker#advanced-deployment","content":"For more advanced deployments, you may also build your own Docker image to hold all your bundles and configuration. Example Dockerfile: # Specifies the base image to build on top of. # This base image includes nodecg-cli, so you don't need to install it separately. # It also creates a nodecg user with appropriate permissions. FROM ghcr.io/nodecg/nodecg:latest # Switches to the nodecg user created by the base image. USER nodecg # This is one way to install a bundle and generate a config for it. # You may need to take a different approach depending on your use case. # Be sure to replace [bundle-repo] and [bundle-name] with actual values and remove the brackets ([]).

COPY --chown=nodecg:nodecg ./cfg/nodecg.json /opt/nodecg/cfg/nodecg.json # The principles outlined above apply to any file that is part of your NodeCG deployment: you can either put it in the container or you can mount it from a volume. The base nodecg/nodecg Docker image already defines volume mount points for the cfg, bundles, logs, db, and assets directories. It is recommended that you mount logs, db, and assets as volumes so that NodeCG can persist data in those folders to the host filesystem, meaning that they will be carried over when you update your Docker image and redeploy. For the cfg and bundles directories, it is up to you whether you want to bake them into your image or if you want to mount them as volumes. # This is how you'd copy a specific bundle from the build directory into your image: COPY --chown=nodecg:nodecg ./bundles/example-bundle /opt/nodecg/bundles/example-bundle # This is how you'd copy all bundles from the build directory into your image: COPY --chown=nodecg:nodecg ./bundles /opt/nodecg/bundles # This is how you'd copy all config files fmr the build directory into your image: # Again, be warned that anyone with access to this image will be able to read the secrets from these files. COPY --chown=nodecg:nodecg ./cfg /opt/nodecg/cfg  Now use Docker to build your image from the Dockerfile you just created: # Be sure to replace [your-image-name] with an actual name and remove the brackets ([]). # Do not omit the &quot;.&quot; at the end of the command. docker build -t [your-image-name] .

To encrypt the traffic, you can use a TLS/SSL termination proxy like: Traefik - Really neat if you host a lot of services in Docker.Docker Flow Proxy - Similar to Traefik.Caddy - Be aware of the licensing of the binaries. It should be ok if you build it yourself e.g. in a Docker image. No guarantee.nginx-proxy w/ letsencrypt - Useful if you're already familiar with nginx or have existing site configurations you'd like to port over.Others - There are a lot of other solutions.

You can use a glob pattern to use multiple entrypoints, if you have multiple pages to compile parcel build src/dashboard/*.html --out-dir dashboard --public-url ./  A detailed reference can be found in the Parcel CLI reference documentation. Recommended Configuration​ Even though it already works for most cases (!), a bit of configuration might be recommended/required. browserslist​ Parcel uses babel out of box, and the default supported browsers are &gt;0.25% which includes old browsers like IE. Considering how NodeCG is used, it's the best to target only modern browsers or just Chrome. To do so, add browserslist property to package.json. For example, { // ... &quot;browserslist&quot;: &quot;last 2 chrome versions&quot;, &quot;nodecg&quot;: //... }  Refer to this page for detailed browserslist syntax. Going further​ Due to the huge amount of features parcel offers out of box, at this point you already have a lot more options for your front-end development. For example: React development with JSX/TSXVue single file componentTypeScript or other alternative languages Also, if your project becomes too advanced for parcel to handle, you can switch to webpack - there are tools that can do this configuration conversion, to either Webpack or other tools like Vite, WMR, or Turbopack.

It also made using filesystem-aware tools like the polymer-bundler (formerly called vulcanize) needlessly difficult.

The idea was to provide a set of base styles that every bundle author could use to try to create a cohesive NodeCG panel design across all bundles. However, this set of styles was far too small and limited to achieve that, and upon further reflection we decided that NodeCG core was not the place to attempt to accomplish this. Additionally, it's possible for these injected styles to cause frustrating conflicts. NodeCG does still inject a few default styles, but the number of styles has been dramatically reduced to just a few necessary things, such as the background color for panels. And, as always, this value can be easily overridden in your panel's CSS. If your panels relied on any of these default styles or helper classes such as nodecg-configure, you will need to manually specify new styles instead.

This is because by default, JavaScript Errors are serialized as an empty Object by JSON.stringify. Now, if the first argument to a sendMessage acknowledgement is an error, it will be properly serialized and sent across the wire. As part of this, we are now strongly encouraging that all sendMessage acknowledgements always be treated as standard error-first Node.js-style callbacks. In addition, client-side sendMessage now also returns a Promise, so that you may use .then/.catch instead of a callback function. See the updated sendMessage documentation for more information. Please note that if you do not specify a callback to your sendMessage, then it will always return a Promise. Additionally, the first argument sent back in your acknowledgement is always assumed to be either an Error or null. If this value is truthy, then it will be used to reject the Promise. For this reason, it is strongly encouraged that all sendMessage acknowledgements strictly adhere to the error-first style of callbacks.

While some users may have found this helpful, over time we've come to realize that this was a misguided decision, and that installation of each bundle's dependencies should really be left to the user. The main rationale for the removal of this feature is that there's a lot more package managers out there than just npm and bower, and it's not reasonable for NodeCG to know about every single one of them and to be able to properly invoke them. The auto-dependency installation system made a lot of assumptions, and it's going to become more and more frequent that these assumptions just aren't valid. For example, if a bundle doesn't have a bower.json, then running bower install on it would actually have unintended side-effects. This is just one example that is easy to fix on its own, but there are many such examples of odd side-effects and unintended consequences of this automatic installation behavior. Together, they paint a clear picture that this feature was misguided, and should be removed. Going forward, users will always need to manually run whatever dependency installation steps are required by the bundle in question. For most bundles, this still means just running npm install --production &amp;&amp; bower install, but this will not always be the case. Each bundle will need to add their dependency installation steps to their READMEs, and make sure that users are educated in the fact that pulling down new updates to a bundle means that they may need to also install updated dependencies.
